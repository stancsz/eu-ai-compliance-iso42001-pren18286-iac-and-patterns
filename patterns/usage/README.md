# Usage Patterns

Operational playbooks demonstrating compliant practices for AI systems. Adapt these templates to your organization and store completed versions in your documentation system. Example instantiations are provided under `examples/` to illustrate how teams can populate each template.

## Available Patterns

- `human_oversight_runbook.md` — how to prepare, execute, and document HITL/HOTL oversight.
- `post_market_monitoring.md` — how to run post-market monitoring cycles and feed results into risk management.
- `data_lineage_workflow.md` — how to capture, validate, and review training/validation data lineage.

> 📂 Populate each pattern with links to source evidence (tickets, dashboards, meeting notes) when instantiated for a specific product or model release.

## Example Instantiations

- `examples/bedrock_customer_support_oversight.md` — Sample HITL workflow for a Bedrock customer-support assistant.
- `examples/vertex_pmm_cycle.md` — Example PMM report summary for a Vertex AI document classifier.
- `examples/data_lineage_case_study.md` — Filled data lineage walkthrough for a mixed cloud dataset.
