# Risk Management Plan (EU AI Act Art. 9, ISO 42001 Cl. 6)

## Overview

- **System Name:** 
- **Owner:** 
- **Scope:** (Bedrock workload / Vertex AI workload)
- **Residual Risk Threshold:** 

## Process Summary

1. Identify hazards/risks per lifecycle stage (design, data prep, training, deployment, operation).
2. Analyze severity, likelihood, and detectability.
3. Define mitigation measures and responsible owners.
4. Validate effectiveness (testing, monitoring, audits).
5. Review residual risk against threshold and escalate if unacceptable.

## Risk Register

| ID | Description | Lifecycle Stage | Severity | Likelihood | Detectability | Mitigation | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------|------------|-------|--------|----------|

## Continuous Monitoring

- Metrics under observation (list).
- Data sources (OpenTelemetry traces, SIEM, PMM dashboards).
- Review cadence and participants.

## Change Management Integration

- Trigger conditions for risk reassessment (model update, dataset change, policy change).
- Link to change tickets and approvals.

## Documentation & Evidence

- Attach testing reports, bias assessments, performance evaluations.
- Reference `templates/risk_register.csv` for detailed log.
