# Service Perimeter Module (Placeholder)

Implement this module to configure VPC Service Controls for Vertex AI projects.

## Requirements

- Accept project IDs, access levels, and restricted services as inputs.
- Apply labels/annotations capturing `aims_control_id` for traceability.
- Output perimeter name and policy doc references for evidence collection.

> Replace with actual Terraform resources (`google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter`, `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter_resource`). Document updates in the control mapping.
